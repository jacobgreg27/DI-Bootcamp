# Exercise 1 : Convert Lists Into Dictionaries
# Instructions
# Convert the two following lists, into dictionaries.
# Hint: Use the zip method
# keys = ['Ten', 'Twenty', 'Thirty']
# values = [10, 20, 30]
# Expected output:
# {'Ten': 10, 'Twenty': 20, 'Thirty': 30}

keys = ['Ten', 'Twenty', 'Thirty']
values = [10, 20, 30]

key_value = dict(zip(keys, values))
print(key_value)



# Exercise 2 : Cinemax
# Instructions
# A movie theater charges different ticket prices depending on a person’s age.
# if a person is under the age of 3, the ticket is free.
# if they are between 3 and 12, the ticket is $10.
# if they are over the age of 12, the ticket is $15.

# Given the following object:

# family = {"rick": 43, 'beth': 13, 'morty': 5, 'summer': 8}


# How much does each family member have to pay ?

# Print out the family’s total cost for the movies.
# Bonus: Ask the user to input the names and ages instead of using the provided family variable 
# (Hint: ask the user for names and ages and add them into a family dictionary that is initially empty).

family = {}

total_cost = 0

while True:
    name = input("Gimme each family member's name right now, ok ? (or 'done' to quit): ")
    if name.lower() == 'done':
        break
    age = int(input("Gimme each family member's age: "))

# Exercise 3: Zara
# Instructions
# Here is some information about a brand.
# name: Zara 
# creation_date: 1975 
# creator_name: Amancio Ortega Gaona 
# type_of_clothes: men, women, children, home 
# international_competitors: Gap, H&M, Benetton 
# number_stores: 7000 
# major_color: 
#     France: blue, 
#     Spain: red, 
#     US: pink, green


# 2. Create a dictionary called brand which value is the information from part one (turn the info into keys and values).
# 3. Change the number of stores to 2.
# 4. Print a sentence that explains who Zaras clients are.
# 5. Add a key called country_creation with a value of Spain.
# 6. Check if the key international_competitors is in the dictionary. If it is, add the store Desigual.
# 7. Delete the information about the date of creation.
# 8. Print the last international competitor.
# 9. Print the major clothes colors in the US.
# 10. Print the amount of key value pairs (ie. length of the dictionary).
# 11. Print the keys of the dictionary.
# 12. Create another dictionary called more_on_zara with the following details:

# creation_date: 1975 
# number_stores: 10 000


# 13. Use a method to add the information from the dictionary more_on_zara to the dictionary brand.
# 14. Print the value of the key number_stores. What just happened ?
