# Create the code that is needed to receive the result provided above. Below are a few questions to assist you with your code:

# Create a class called Farm. How should it be implemented?
# Does the Farm class need an __init__ method? If so, what parameters should it take?
# How many methods does the Farm class need?
# Do you notice anything interesting about the way we are calling the add_animal method? What parameters should this function have? How many…?
# Test your code and make sure you get the same results as the example above.
# Bonus: nicely line the text in columns as seen in the example above. Use string formatting.


# Expand The Farm
# Add a method called get_animal_types to the Farm class. This method should return a sorted list of all the animal types (names) in the farm. With the example above, the list should be: ['cow', 'goat', 'sheep'].

# Add another method to the Farm class called get_short_info. This method should return the following string: “McDonald’s farm has cows, goats and sheep.”. The method should call the get_animal_types function to get a list of the animals.
