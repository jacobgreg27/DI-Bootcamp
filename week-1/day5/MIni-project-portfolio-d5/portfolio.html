        <div>
            <p> As a Junior Front-End Web Developer. I spend my whole day, practically every day, 
            experimenting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; dabbling with Python and Ruby; and inhaling 
            a wide variety of potentially useless information through a few hundred RSS feeds. 
            I build websites that delight and inform. I do it well. <br>
            
            I’m curious, and I enjoy work that challenges me to learn something new and stretch 
            in a different direction. I do my best to stay on top of changes in the state 
            of the art so that I can meet challenges with tools well suited to the job at hand. 
            The list of projects I follow on GitHub will give you a good idea of the types of tools 
            I’d prefer to be using, and my Instapaper “Starred” list will give you a glimpse 
            into the reading material I find interesting enough to share. <br>
